<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Tip O' The Hat: Pool Tips, Fund Awesomeness - A community initiative on Farcaster to promote & reward exceptional casts by pooling tips & conferring them to deserving creators incentivising quality & community.

Three stages: nomination, voting, distribution.

Users can nominate one cast per day. Nomination power is tripled for power badge holders.

The top five nominated casts proceed to voting. Power badge holders (only) can vote once per day.

Tips go to the cast creator. If the creator tags others, the tip is split equally. Roadmap: allow casters to specify percentage splits.
